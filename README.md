# bowling-scoring

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

How do I solve the problem of bowling, I imagine creating a game that is all the rolls with the calculation of the score of each frame with their respective total score so far. I believe that follows the presented example and how the scores in the bowling usually come around.
Any vector numbers can be passed to the function and will calculate the partial scores.
